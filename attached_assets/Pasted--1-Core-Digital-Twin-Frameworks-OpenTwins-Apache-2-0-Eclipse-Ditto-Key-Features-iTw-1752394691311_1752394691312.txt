ðŸ§  Next Steps

Review each project's license to ensure compatibility with Stahikiâ€™s roadmap (prefer MIT or Apache; AGPL may require openâ€‘sourcing your code).

Fork meaningful modules and start prototyping: 

Assemble OpenTwins + Ditto backend

Connect Nodeâ€‘RED for logic builder

Integrate PlayCanvas front-end & Grafana dashboards

Re-brand and layer your generative AI features: 

AI suggestions for 3D asset creation

Autoâ€‘logic flows

Realâ€‘time twin learning and simulation

Document all changes and maintain clear ownership boundaries between forked and original code.

Let me know if you want direct GitHub links, help with license compatibility, or even scaffold code to combine these into a working MVP stack.
